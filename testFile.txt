This is a test file. It's filled with random stuff that doesn't make any difference,
just a stream of characters and consciousness that goes on for the requisite number of
characters needed to test this program properly. Hopefully it works, because man, these
project specs. Don't forget some error handling, so you can use perror, because it's 
worth 10 points, ya know! Insert a meme here, preferably a funny one. You don't know one?
That's too bad.
